A company stores sensitive files in an Amazon S3 bucket. 
The company uploads files periodically from an application that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. 
A network engineer must encrypt all the files that the company uploads to the S3 bucket in transit.

Which solution will meet these requirements?
```
- Configure a bucket policy that denies all actions that are sent over an unencrypted connection.


> Correct. 
> The aws:SecureTransport IAM condition key checks whether a request was made over a secure connection. 
> This key, along with a deny statement, will prevent any action on an S3 bucket that is sent over an unsecure channel.
> For more information about S3 encryption in transit, see Security Best Practices for Amazon S3.

A company plans to migrate applications from its on-premises data center to the AWS Cloud. 
The company will begin by hosting 20 applications in a single AWS Region. 
The company plans to use a dedicated AWS account for each application because of a company policy.

These applications require connectivity to the existing on-premises infrastructure for the company's application authentication service. 
Some of the applications require connectivity to other applications that the company will also move to AWS. 
After the successful migration of the 20 applications, the next migration phase will migrate 1,000 applications.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST management overhead?

A network engineer needs to find a solution that prevents DNS traffic from being hijacked. 
The network engineer has configured DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) in Amazon Route 53. 
However, the KeySigningKey status is ACTION_NEEDED. This status causes a connectivity outage for the clients that use DNS validating resolvers.

Which action will resolve this issue?

A security engineer pings an Amazon EC2 instance from a home computer (IP address 203.0.113.12) but does not receive a response. 
The security engineer finds the following two records in the VPC flow logs:

2 123456789010 eni-1235b8ca123456789 203.0.113.12 172.31.16.139 0 0 1 4 336 1432917027 1432917142 ACCEPT OK
